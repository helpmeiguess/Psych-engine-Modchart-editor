# Psych-engine-Modchart-editor
Open source modchart maker for FNF.

WARNING: This is in VERY early access, and some things in the editor have no use and are left over from the original chartingstate.

How to get source:
Download Shadowmario's Psych engine 0.5.1
Replace Chartingstate.hx, FunkinLua.hx, Note.hx, Strumnote.hx, with the files i provided, and add ModChartingState to the editors folder.
How to use:
Go into any song and press 9 to go into the modchart editor.
Move left and right by holding shift and using scroll wheel.
Try placing a note, you can see that the note in the corresponding lane will start blinking. Try grabbing the note and moving it around. If you press space and play, you can see that the note will move to the position you moved it to.
In the events tab, there are six values; Note number, Tween length (can be adjusted with Q and E), X position relative to the original position of the note, Y position also relative to the position of the note, opacity (Value between 1 and 0, can be adjusted faster by HOLDING THE NOTE and pressing J or L), angle (Can be adjusted faster by HOLDING THE NOTE and pressing A or D)

Bugs:
Sometimes, move a note and play the first time, the note will move to the wrong position. Will work this out in the next update.
If there are too many notes, this will cause a lot of lag when pressing space, sometimes.
Notes in the first tile in sections sometimes wont play their tween.
Many others that I am not aware of, please tell me!
